<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, I’ve built a program that is able to evaluate bezier curves and bezier surfaces using de Casteljau’s algorithm. In addition, I’ve built a program that is able to perform edge operations like edge flip and edge flip on triangle meshes. Finally, I wrote code to run the Loop Subdivision algorithm which upsamples a triangle mesh. As a whole, this project is more about writing code to modify triangle meshes of various shapes. I think the thing I found the most interesting was how implementing the area-weighted vertex normal helped the mesh look. The shading was way smoother with the algorithm making the object look a lot more realistic. I’ve learned a lot about working with triangle meshes in this project since every part is so tedious and any error cascades throughout the mesh. When I was writing the loop subdivision algorithm, it took me a while to figure out that there was a small bug in my edge flip which causes my loop subdivision to not work properly. I would see parts of the mesh not getting shade in as a result of this.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>
 <p>In this part of the project, I implemented the evaluateStep function which performs one step of de Casteljau’s Algorithm. De Casteljau’s algorithm is a recursive algorithm used to evaluate bezier curves. The algorithm outputs a point that lies on the bezier curve given a set of control points. The implementation was fairly simple and involved using linear interpolation given a parameter t. This function requires only one step of evaluation for the de Casteljau’s algorithm, which means I just had to pair up the neighboring points and run a LERP function on them. Given n control points, the function will return n-1 points based on the LERP calculation.</p>
<p>The implementation of this part was fairly straightforward so I had no significant bugs during coding.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<p>
	De Casteljau’s algorithm can be extended to Bezier surfaces if we break down the control points into 2 parts and apply the algorithm accordingly. In the example, there’s a set of (n x n) control points, and therefore we can break them down into n groups of n control points. We separate apply de Casteljau’s algorithm to each group to get 1 single point per group using a parameter u. Then, we apply de Casteljau’s algorithm to those points using parameter v. The evaluationStep function follows the same structure as the one from the previous part. The difference is now the points are in 3D instead of 2D. The evaluate1D function runs all the iterations of the recursive algorithm until we get down 1 point given n control points. The evaluate function calls the evaluate1D functions and run the algorithm like described above.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>
<p>
	To implement the area-weighted vertex normal, I had to iterate through all the faces that are connected to the targeted vertex. For every iteration, I fetched the face’s normal and summed them up. After summing them up, I normalize the vector and return it to the normal function. The faces cannot be accessed directly; therefore, I need to use the half-edges. Using the twin and next attributes of the half-edge, I can traverse through all the faces connected to the vertex.

<p>
	The implementation of edge flip requires keeping track of and reassigning a lot of variables including edges, half edges, vertices, and faces. In the beginning, I had to extract the variables from the given EdgeIter parameter. Then, I went through all the variables one by one and reassigned them to the appropriate value, according to the diagram above. All of the half-edges associated with the flip-edge need to be assigned to the right values using the setNeighbor function. In order to fetch the half edges, I used the twin and next attributes. The vertices are also obtained by fetching the corresponding half edges that point outwards. The edges and faces are obtained by taking the half-edge that is part of that edge or face.</p>
<p>
	I had a slight bug where I used the wrong variable when calling the setNeighbor function. This was due to the number of variables that I had to keep track of. After resolving that issue,  my implementation worked out.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<p>
	The implementation of edge split is a bit more complicated than edge flip, because in addition to reassigning I have to create new elements to the mesh. In my implementation, I fetched all the existing half-edges, faces, vertices, and edges that are associated with the edge split. Then, I created all the new elements to the mesh. I created 2 faces, 3 edges, 6 half-edges, and 1 vertex. Next, I reassign all the existing and newly created elements to their appropriate value based on the diagram I drew. Before I started the coding, I drew out what the newly created edge split would look like with all the new elements. After the reassignment, I returned the newly created vertex. I did not have much trouble with this section, because I drew out what the edge-split would look like. The assignment of all elements was done correctly in my first attempt. I did not implement the support for boundary edges, and just return the original vertex in that case.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<p>
	The implementation of the upsampling function is quite complicated. In the beginning, I had to loop through all the vertices in the mesh and compute the new position of each vertex. The new position follows the formula given in the lecture [Pos = (1 - n * u) * original_postion + u * sum_of_neighbors]. After doing that, I looped through all the edges and computed each edge’s new position based on the formula [pos = (⅜) * (A + B) + (⅛) * (C + D)]. Next, I went through all the members of the original edge set and applied the split function which adds components to the mesh. Then, I went through and flipped all the edges that connect an old vertex to a new vertex. Finally, I went through all the vertices and applied the new position to them. My debugging trick is to use the debugger to try and check values while also looking at the output mesh in the GUI. The biggest problem I ran into was when I tried to loop through the edge set to split the edges. This has to be done only with the original edge set since the edge set keeps growing with the split operation and thus makes the function run infinitely. I need to use the variable nEdges to retrieve the original size of the edge set and loop through those instead.
</p>
<p>
	Sharp corners and edges within the original mesh get smoothed out when we run the Loop subdivision algorithm. You can reduce the smoothing effect of the loop subdivision by pre-splitting some of the triangle meshes in the original mesh. If we pre-split the mesh, the final output of the subdivision algorithm will retain sharper corners and edges. 
</p>
<p>
	In order to make the Loop Subdivision algorithm more symmetrical, we can pre-split the cube faces. I split each face of the cube up into 8 triangles per face, which makes the cube more symmetrical after running the loop subdivision algorithm. The loop subdivision algorithm uses a combination of splits and flips which causes a bias towards a particular axis making the cube asymmetrical. We can pre-split the cube to neutralize the bias and make the subdivision more symmetrical. Originally each cube face is subdivided into two triangles which are not equilateral triangles; thus, the division becomes biased in one axis. After splitting the face into 4 equilateral triangles the algorithm becomes more symmetrical.

<p>
    I had some trouble with doing the calculations for the new points in this part. I was using integers like 3 and 8 to do the calculations, but I had to use floats such as 3.0 and 8.0. This gave the wrong precision which affected the quality of my mesh when rendered.
